## Usage Guidelines for AI Context

### Best Practices for Claude AI
1. **Long Context Optimization**: Documents are structured with essential information at the top
2. **XML-Style Organization**: Content uses clear hierarchical structures
3. **Quote-Friendly Format**: Key concepts are easily extractable for grounding responses
4. **Modular Design**: Each document focuses on a specific domain area

### Context Loading Strategy
- Start with `architecture/system-overview.md` for general understanding
- Use feature-specific documents for targeted questions
- Reference deployment documents for CI/CD and build processes
- Consult workflow documents for user journey understanding

## Quick Reference

### Core Commands
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run deploy

# Process media
npm run process-photos -- 512x512 jpg studio{increment}
npm run process-video -- '[{"inputName":"video.mp4","outputName":"audio.mp3"}]'

# Full site refresh
npm run deploy-full-refresh

# Development server
npm run serve
```

### Key Directories
- `thoughts-and-musings/` - Source markdown content
- `public/` - Built website files
- `process_photos/` - Photo processing workspace
- `process_video/` - Video processing workspace
- `.github/scripts/` - Deployment and build scripts

### Important Files
- `build-musings.js` - Markdown to HTML converter
- `package.json` - Project configuration and scripts
- `public/js/gallery.js` - Gallery and lightbox functionality
- `public/css/theme.css` - Complete site theming

## Maintenance Notes

This knowledge base should be updated when:
- New features are added to the project
- Deployment processes change
- Dependencies are updated
- Architecture modifications are made

## AI Integration Notes

This knowledge base is optimized for Claude AI's 200K token context window and follows Anthropic's best practices for:
- Long document processing
- Multi-document analysis
- Structured information retrieval
- Context-aware responses
